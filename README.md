hub is a command line tool that wraps `git` in order to extend it with extra
features and commands that make working with GitHub easier.

This repository and its issue tracker is **not for reporting problems with
GitHub.com** web interface. If you have a problem with GitHub itself, please
[contact Support](https://github.com/contact).

Usage
-----

``` sh
$ hub clone rtomayko/tilt

# expands to:
$ git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/tilt.git
```

hub can be safely [aliased](#aliasing) as `git` so you can type `$ git
<command>` in the shell and get all the usual `hub` features.

See [Usage documentation](https://hub.github.com/hub.1.html) for the list of all
commands and their arguments.

Hub can also be used to make shell scripts that [manually interface with the
GitHub API](https://hub.github.com/hub-api.1.html).

`git`, it's recommended to have at least **git 1.7.3** or newer.

```

1

`hub` can be easily installed as an executable. Download the latest
[compiled binaries](https://github.com/github/hub/releases) and put it anywhere
in your executable path.

#### Source

With your [GOPATH](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GOPATH) already set up:

```sh
mkdir -p "$GOPATH"/src/github.com/github
git clone \
  --config transfer.fsckobjects=false \
  --config receive.fsckobjects=false \
  --config fetch.fsckobjects=false \
  https://github.com/github/hub.git "$GOPATH"/src/github.com/github/hub
cd "$GOPATH"/src/github.com/github/hub
make install prefix=/usr/local
```

Prerequisites for compilation are:

* `make`
* [Go 1.9+](http://golang.org/doc/install)

Aliasing
--------

Some hub features feel best when it's aliased as `git`. This is not dangerous; your
_normal git commands will all work_. hub merely adds some sugar.

`hub alias` displays instructions for the current shell. With the `-s` flag, it
outputs a script suitable for `eval`.

You should place this command in your `.bash_profile` or other startup script:

``` sh
eval "$(hub alias -s)"
```

#### PowerShell

If you're using PowerShell, you can set an alias for `hub` by placing the
following in your PowerShell profile (usually
`~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`):

``` sh
Set-Alias git hub
```

A simple way to do this is to run the following from the PowerShell prompt:

``` sh
Add-Content $PROFILE "`nSet-Alias git hub"
```

Note: You'll need to restart your PowerShell console in order for the changes to be picked up.

If your PowerShell profile doesn't exist, you can create it by running the following:

``` sh
New-Item -Type file -Force $PROFILE
```
